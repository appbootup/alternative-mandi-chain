# alternative-mandi-chain

This solution provides an alternative mechanism to farmers to use the distributed ledger (multichain) to track the records of Farm Products.

The Process starts with a User Registering himself/herself via a Onbaording web application followed by one of our associate helping him to get registered depending on his roles.

A User(farmer) will register himself and will call for the Aggregator who will come and pick up the products and will validate it as per the standards(as per the APEDA standards). Once validated it will be put into the auction table and auction will happen for 1 hour.The interested parties i.e. buyers which can be individuals,retail owners or the wholesale dealers can buy it directly from the aution table.

If incase a product does not get sold in the auction then it will be send back to the existing Mandi's.
